## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.
This project consists in creating an online game of Hangman with python. 

## Rules
Briefly describe the rules of the game.
The system will provide an aleatory word. The user try to guess the word one letter at a time.
The system will display a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word.  
If the guessing user suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the system fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. 
If the word does not contain the suggested letter, the system add one element of the hangmanâ€™s gallows.
Objective : Guess the word before your man gets hung!
