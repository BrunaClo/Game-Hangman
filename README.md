## Project Description
Write a short description of your project. Write 1-2 sentences about the game you chose to build and why.

This project consists in creating an online game of Hangman with python. 

## Rules
Briefly describe the rules of the game.

The system will provide an aleatory word. 
The pllayer try to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time or by guessing the entire word.
The system will display a number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word.  
If the guessing user suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the system fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. 
If the word does not contain the suggested letter or word, the system add one element of the hangmanâ€™s gallows.
Objective : Guess the word before your man gets hung!

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?

Friday : Brain storm about the rules of the game and how it could be wrote in python.
Saturday : Parallel working in the code. Exchanging questions, ideas and possible solutions.
Creating and testing the game. 
Initial elaboration of the README file.
Sunday : Comparison of works, corrections, improvements and finalization of the game.
PPT elaboration for the presentation. 
Completion of the README file.  

## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?

We create a repository that was forked and avaible for the both.
One file for the game code was created but susceptible to merging. 
We worked in differents files to avoid conflicts but in constant contact to understand each other works.
 
What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.

Three folders containing :
(1) one version of the game code.
(2) the text file containing a list of word.
(3) the png files of the display of the hangman that we tried to import.
The repository got two files of the game code, plus the README file and a text file with a list of word.

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
